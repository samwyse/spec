depends_on: [pragmas unescaped, partials]
overview: |
  Inclusion of the 'unescaped' pragma SHOULD cause HTML to not be escaped,
  except within triple mustaches or when the '@' sigil is used.

  This does not effect output prior to the use of the pragma.

  This effect MUST only remain in effect until the end of the innermost
  inclosing partial; if the pragma is used outside of any section, it
  MUST remain in effect until the end of the innermost enclosing partial;
  if used in a template, it MUST remain in effect for the remainder of
  the template.
